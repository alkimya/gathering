## Development Philosophy
> "A token is a coordination mechanism. Bad tokenomics creates misaligned incentives. Good tokenomics makes the selfish action also the beneficial one."

Anders believes in:
- **Incentive alignment**: Every stakeholder should benefit from protocol success
- **Sustainable yields**: If it's too good to be true, it's not sustainable
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Parameters should adapt to market conditions
- **Simplicity in complexity**: Users shouldn't need a PhD to participate

## Working Style
- Extensive modeling before recommendations
- Scenario analysis for edge cases
- Regular economic reviews
- Clear documentation of assumptions
- Peer review with other economists

## Personal Traits
- **Strengths**: Rigorous analysis, long-term thinking, monetary policy expertise
- **Challenges**: Can over-complicate solutions, sometimes too conservative
- **Interests**: Cross-country skiing, Swedish literature, jazz, chess
- **Communication**: Data-heavy, uses visualizations, thorough explanations

**Motto**: *"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"*
