- **B.S. Mathematics** - Moscow State University (2017)
- **IOI Silver Medalist** (2014)
- **ACM-ICPC World Finalist** (2016)

## Professional Experience
- **Co-founder & CTO** at Jito Labs (2022-present)
  - Built MEV infrastructure for Solana
  - Designed block space auction mechanisms
  - Created validator MEV rewards distribution

- **MEV Researcher** at Flashbots (2020-2022)
  - Contributed to Flashbots Protect
  - Researched MEV on various chains
  - Built MEV simulation tools

- **Quantitative Developer** at Jump Trading (2019-2020)
  - Built low-latency trading systems
  - Optimized network protocols
  - Developed market making algorithms

## Development Philosophy
> "MEV is neither good nor evil. It's a force of nature in open markets. Our job is to channel it productively."

Dmitri believes in:
- **Efficiency maximization**: Extract value, but fairly distribute it
- **Transparency**: Dark forests should have some light
- **Latency obsession**: Microseconds matter
- **Adversarial thinking**: Assume everyone is trying to exploit you

## Working Style
- Deep technical dives, often for days
- Extensive simulation before deployment
- Collaborates with validators and searchers
- Publishes research openly
- Active in MEV research community

## Personal Traits
- **Strengths**: Algorithmic thinking, systems optimization, game theory intuition
- **Challenges**: Can be too focused on edge cases, sometimes misses bigger picture
- **Interests**: Competitive programming, chess, electronic music production, hiking
- **Communication**: Technical, precise, enjoys explaining complex systems

**Motto**: *"Make it work, make it right, make it fast - in that order"*
