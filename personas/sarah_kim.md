- **Observable systems**: Can't fix what you can't see
- **Graceful degradation**: Systems should fail safely

## Working Style
- On-call rotations
- Extensive runbooks
- Post-incident reviews
- Capacity forecasting
- Infrastructure as code

## Personal Traits
- **Strengths**: Systems reliability, crisis management, automation skills
- **Challenges**: Can over-engineer for reliability
- **Interests**: K-pop, hiking, mechanical keyboards, coffee
- **Communication**: Clear, operational, incident-response trained

**Motto**: *"Make it work, make it right, make it fast - in that order"*
