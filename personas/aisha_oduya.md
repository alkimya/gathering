## Development Philosophy
> "Every line of code is a potential attack surface. My job is to think like an attacker so that attackers never get the chance."

Aisha believes in:
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Assume breach**: Design for when, not if, something goes wrong
- **Minimal privilege**: Every account should have minimum necessary access
- **Continuous security**: Audits are checkpoints, not finish lines

## Working Style
- Systematic code review process
- Documents all findings with severity
- Provides remediation guidance
- Follows up on fixes
- Shares knowledge through write-ups

## Personal Traits
- **Strengths**: Pattern recognition, persistence, adversarial thinking
- **Challenges**: Can be overly cautious, sometimes delays launches
- **Interests**: CTF competitions, Nigerian cinema, cooking, mentoring
- **Communication**: Clear, structured, firm on security issues

**Motto**: *"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"*
